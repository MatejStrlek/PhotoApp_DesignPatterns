# üì∏ Photo Upload & Management Application

This project is developed as part of the **Advanced Application Development Based on Development Templates**. It is a fully functional photo-sharing web application built using **Spring Boot (MVC, Security, Scheduling)** and **Thymeleaf**. It supports multiple user types, package-based upload limits, image storage (local/Cloudinary), and detailed design pattern usage throughout the layers.

- Changes take effect the next day
- Scheduled task processes requests daily

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Photo storage** supports:
  - Local file system (`@Profile("local")`)
  - Cloudinary (`@Profile("cloudinary")`)
- Active profile is set via:  
  `spring.profiles.active=local` or `cloudinary`
- User actions are logged in audit logs

## üß† Design Patterns Used

This project includes the use of multiple **design patterns**, both explicitly implemented and implicitly used via Spring:

| Pattern                    | Layer                     | How It's Used                                                                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Strategy**               | Business / Service Layer   | `ImageStorageStrategy` and `PackageLimitStrategy` to switch logic per profile/package |
| **Factory Method**         | Business Logic             | `PackageLimitStrategyFactory` returns correct upload strategy based on package type |
| **Command**                | Scheduling Layer           | `ChangeUserPackageCommand` encapsulates the action to update user packages daily |
| **Builder**                | Service Layer              | Used in `MyUserDetailsService` to construct `UserDetails` with chained methods |
| **Singleton**              | All Layers (Spring)        | Spring-managed beans (`@Service`, `@Component`, `@Repository`) are singletons |
| **Decorator**              | Business Logic             | Used in a decorator package to extend behavior for photo objects |
| **Iterator**               | Presentation (Thymeleaf)   | Used in `.html` views with `th:each` for looping photos and packages |
| **Chain of Responsibility**| Security Layer (Spring)    | Spring Security filter chain processes requests step-by-step |
| **Proxy**                  | Service Layer (Spring)     | Spring AOP proxies handle `@Transactional` and `@Async` logic transparently |

## üß™ How to Run Locally

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatejStrlek/PhotoApp_DesignPatterns.git
cd PhotoApp_DesignPatterns
```

### üîê Step 2: Configure API Keys and Secrets

Add the following values to `src/main/resources/application.properties`

#### üü¶ GitHub OAuth

Create an OAuth app at [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) ‚Üí OAuth Apps, and add:

```bash
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
```

#### üü• Google OAuth

Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) ‚Üí Credentials, and add:

```bash
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudinary (Optional)

Sign up at [cloudinary.com](cloudinary.com) and get your cloud name, API key, and secret. Add these values:

```bash
cloudinary.cloud-name=YOUR_CLOUD_NAME
cloudinary.api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
cloudinary.api-secret=YOUR_API_SECRET
```

### üåç Step 3: Set Active Spring Profile

Choose a storage strategy by setting the active profile in `application.properties`:

```bash

# Testing Concepts

### Introduction
Software testing is the process of evaluating an application to ensure it meets the expected 
requirements and performs reliably under various conditions.

### Purpose of Testing
Testing serves to:
- Detect **bugs and errors** early in the development cycle
- Validate that the system conforms to both **specification** and **user needs**
- Improve **software quality** by ensuring functional and performance correctness
- Enable safer **refactoring** and reduce long-term development costs

### Testing Levels
We follow a layered testing strategy, applying multiple testing levels:

| Level               | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing**     | Tests individual components (e.g. methods) in isolation using mocks     |
| **Integration Testing** | Verifies interactions between components (e.g., Controller + Service) |
| **System Testing**     | Ensures the application works as a whole                              |
| **Acceptance Testing** | Confirms that the system meets the customer‚Äôs requirements             |

These levels help uncover issues at different stages of development.

### Unit Testing
Unit testing focuses on verifying individual modules in isolation. It follows a **white-box** approach, 
meaning the developer tests internal logic directly. Characteristics:
- Written and maintained by developers
- No interaction with databases or external systems
- Encourages smaller, tighter, decoupled code
- Supports continuous integration practices

Frameworks and tools used:
- JUnit ‚Äì for test structure and assertions
- Mockito ‚Äì for mocking dependencies like repositories

Example: `ConsumptionServiceTest` ensures that `getMaxUploadSizeMb()` correctly calculates the maximum 
upload size based on the user's package.

### Integration Testing
Once individual units are tested, **integration testing** checks whether they work correctly together. It:
- Validates component interactions (e.g., controller + service + repository)
- Helps uncover issues like misconfigured beans, serialization problems and business logic integration bugs

We use:
- `@SpringBootTest` to load the full application context
- Embedded H2 database for realistic data flow

### UI / Controller Testing
We test the controller layer using:
- **MockMvc** with `@WebMvcTest`

We verify:
- Correct view names
- HTTP response status
- Form submission handling

This simulates browser requests to ensure the frontend and backend interact correctly.

### Testing Methodologies
#### üî≥ Black-box Testing
- No knowledge of code internals
- Based on expected input/output behavior
- Applied in UI testing and acceptance testing

#### ‚ö™ White-box Testing
- Based on internal logic and structure
- Used in unit testing (e.g., branch coverage, conditions)

### Verification vs Validation
- **Verification**: "Are we building the product right?" (meets the spec)
- **Validation**: "Are we building the right product?" (meets user need)

We apply both principles: verifying implementation matches the spec and validating user workflows through UI testing.

### Mocking

Mocking is the process of simulating external dependencies or behaviors:
- Allows isolated testing (e.g., no real DB)
- Enables inspection of method calls and arguments

We use Mockito to:
- Replace `UserRepository`, `PhotoRepository`, etc., with fake implementations
- Focus tests purely on logic, not external effects

### Test Case Design
Each test case follows this structure:
- What is being tested (requirement)
- Test data used
- Steps to execute the test
- Expected result
- Pass/fail condition

### Summary
We designed our testing approach around best practices. It ensures:
- Code is reliable and robust
- Components are loosely coupled and testable
- Features behave correctly across all layers
- Refactoring can be done safely

This approach helps us maintain high quality as the project evolves.
